# Configuration file for markdown-to-pdf converter
# List all markdown files you want to convert to PDF
#
# IMPORTANT: Use RELATIVE paths from the repository root
# For GitHub Actions: Paths must be relative to the repository root
# For local use: Paths can be relative or absolute (if files exist locally)
#
# The output PDF will be created in the output_dir specified in the action

files:
  - path: README.md
  # Add more files as needed (use relative paths):
  # - path: docs/user-guide.md
  # - path: docs/developer-guide.md
  # - path: CHANGELOG.md
  #
  # ❌ DON'T use absolute paths in GitHub Actions:
  # - path: /Users/yourname/project/file.md  # This won't work!
